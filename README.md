# MimiFUND-MimiFAIR-Flat.jl

This project is a demonstration of how to efficiently link together the simple FAIR climate model (two versions of FAIR are available here) with the FUND integrate assessment model.  It is intended to be an illustration of the Mimi functionalities and API around linking two models together, and we will build out this README but for now please **view the notebooks**, `MimFUND-MimiFAIR-Flat.ipynb` and `MimiFUND-MimiFAIR162-Flat.ipynb`, which use two different versions of the FAIR model, for a thorough explanation of the steps and results.

In addition, the `WIP-SCC` holds some excellent preliminary work carried out by a collaborator [tammyt123](https://github.com/tammyt123) to implement functions to compute the Social Cost of Carbon.  Again these are illustrative, the results have not been validated as of now.

Collaboration, contributions, and questions are all welcome!
